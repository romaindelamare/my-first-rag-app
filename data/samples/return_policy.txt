Return Policy — Customer Satisfaction Program

Our company is committed to ensuring the satisfaction of every customer who makes a purchase through our platform. If you are not fully satisfied with your order, you may be eligible to return it under the terms outlined below.

1. Eligibility for Returns

Customers may request a return for most products within 30 days of delivery, provided the item is in good condition, free from excessive damage, and includes all original packaging and accessories.

2. Conditions for Accepted Returns

To qualify for return approval, items must meet the following conditions:

Product must be unused or gently used with no signs of excessive wear

All included components such as manuals, cables, or accessories must be present

Packaging should be intact, except for normal unsealing

The product must not fall under the list of non-returnable items (see Page 2)

Upon receiving the return request, our customer service team will provide further instructions, along with a prepaid return label when applicable.

3. Return Authorization

All returns must be pre-approved. Unauthorized returns may be rejected or significantly delayed.
Customers must include the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number provided during the approval process.
